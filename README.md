# Multi-Screen Window Placement on the Web

This repository considers web platform functionality for multi-screen devices.
The goals here are to explore background, use cases, and proposals for extending
window placement capabilities of web applications on multi-screen devices.

See the [Editorâ€™s Draft](https://webscreens.github.io/window-placement) of the proposed specification.

[Additional Explorations](https://github.com/webscreens/window-placement/blob/master/additional_explorations.md),
and [Security and Privacy](https://github.com/webscreens/window-placement/blob/master/security_and_privacy.md)
documents also have historical context and some deeper dives into these topics.
File [new issues](https://github.com/webscreens/window-placement/issues/new/choose), reply to our
